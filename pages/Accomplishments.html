             <p >Throughout my years of being in school, I believe I would be considered an average student at most. Since elementary school, I had never really applied myself to do better than the rate that I was going at, because I felt it was "good enough". However, ever since high school, I've started to take my education more seriously and I've been working hard toward my goals. I can proudly say that I've been an honour roll student ever since grade 9, and I plan on keeping it up to the best of my ability!</p>

    <h2>The Real World</h2>

            <p>The real world is a lot different than what it may seem like. Once, I got the opportunity to work at a pharmacy as a pharmacist assistant, and it was one of the coolest yet most challenging experience I've had in life. After I had worked there I had learned so many things about the career and really got to see hands on how it was like when you get out of school and get into the working environment. I hope that everyone gets to experience what I got to experience at least once during their years in highschool, since it taught me a lot.</p>
