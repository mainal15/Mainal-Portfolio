             <h2>Behind the Code</h2>
                 <p>Hello! My name is Mainal, and I’m the person behind the coding that makes up this website. I’m currently a high school student, and this website is part of my coding learning journey. I’ve had no previous experience in coding, and so I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn how to in the Computer Science course. You can find out about my interests, hobbies, and future goals in the “Behind the Coding” page on the site! </p>

             <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                 <p>In my years of high school, I’ve had the chance to experience various learning opportunities and learn a new skill, concept, or idea whether it be in the school environment or outside school. I love working hard in order to see the results and apply my learning to things in real life. You can learn about the goals I've achieved that I am most proud of, and be aware of my future goals that I’m currently working towards on the Accomplishments page!</p>

             <h2>Assignments</h2>
                  <p>During my coding journey, I will be sharing everything I have done, such as coding assignments that I have worked on and completed in the Computer Science course to show my learning. I will talk about which ones I enjoyed the most, my strengths and my weaknesses on the assignments.
